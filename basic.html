Title: 5 basic tags notes

The five basic tags are aligned furthest to the left in the document.
All nested elements inside the basic tags will be indented.  HTML does not care about whitespace!  We just use it to organize our code.
-->
<!DOCTYPE HTML>  <!-- Indicate the version of HTML being used. This is for HTML5 -->

<html>  <!-- Tells the browser to start parsing the html code inside -->

<head>  <!-- Mostly non-visual element associated with the page; often referred to as metadata, or info about the page info -->

	<title>Hello World.</title> <!-- title of page; displays in the browser tab -->

</head>

<body>  <!-- all the page content; where all visual element of the page reside -->
	<!-- HTML does not care about capitalization/case, however we should be consistent and usually lowercase is preferred. -->
	
	<!-- a tag to signify a text paragraph -->
	<p>This is a text paragraph to display on a web page. </p>  

	<!-- Elements contained within other elements should be nested, or tabbed, and vertically aligned.-->
